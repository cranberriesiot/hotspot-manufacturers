## The Cranberries Technology-Light Hotspot C1
Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. 

## Summary
The Cranberries Technology are very much in agreement with the idea of the helium network——"The People's Network". Therefore, we are delighted to become a third-party manufacturer and build a high-efficiency hotspot. We hope to become a major Helium hotspot provider and promoter, and will keep investing on and contributing to Helium network.

## Company Information (required)

The Cranberries Technology Co. LTD., a start-up for helium, was founded in Shanghai in 2021.

Since 2019, our leaders have been promoting helium in communities and crypto forums. So far, we have the largest helium community in China.

We know very well about the Helium gateways. Our team is one of the first to deploy gateways in China, and since March 2021, we have helped the bobcat give roadshows about their helium hotspots. In this process, we have accumulated a lot of experience and resources. 

Additionally, our CTO is from [EDA Technology](https://edatec.cn). EDATEC is one of [Raspberry Pi's Global Design Partners](https://www.raspberrypi.org/for-industry/design-partners/) that is serving global customers with standard hardware products, custom design, and manufacturing services based on Raspberry Pi Technology platform in IoT, Industrial Control, Automation & Artificial Intelligence applications. EDATEC has been working on IoT for years and has several mature IoT Gateway solutions for LoRaWAN and Bluetooth Mesh networks. They launched the LoRa IoT Gateway solution in 2018, which is based on Semtech SX1301 and Raspberry Pi Computer Module 3+. Our CTO leads his team to offer solutions for IoT, Industrial Control, Automation, Computing & Artificial Intelligence solutions based on the Raspberry Pi Technology platform. We currently have over a dozen developers with an average of 4 years of experience in developing the IoT market, intensive embedded hardware and software design. We've been planning for a helium light hotspot for a long time, and have already made the prototype of the machine. 
  

We appreciate the value of Helium and the idea of the people's network. We regard Helium as not just an IoT project, but also the infrastructure of Web3. Now, with an understanding of the hotspot and a commitment to the concept, we plan to promote the people's network and work towards the global realization of UBI (Universal basic income).
